# NPM vs Yarn

Both **NPM (Node Package Manager)** and **Yarn** are package managers used for managing dependencies in JavaScript projects, primarily those built on Node.js. While they serve the same purpose, they have differences in performance, features, and approach.

## Installation

- **NPM**: Comes pre-installed with Node.js, so no extra installation is required.  
  Example:  
  ```bash
  npm -v
  node -v
  ```

- **Yarn**: Requires a separate installation via NPM or directly through the Yarn website.  
  Example:  
  ```bash
  npm install -g yarn
  yarn --version
  ```
