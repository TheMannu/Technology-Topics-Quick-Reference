# Why Monitoring is Required

### Key Reasons:
- **Automatic Log Deletion:** If the server goes down, logs may be automatically deleted, leading to loss of critical debugging information.
- **Manual Log Inspection:** In large environments, manually checking logs on multiple servers is inefficient and error-prone.
- **Smart Attackers:** Attackers often delete logs to cover their tracks, making timely monitoring critical.
- **Storage Limitations:** Keeping old logs on servers requires substantial storage, slowing down machines over time.

Prometheus is an open-source toolkit for monitoring and alerting. It supports hardware and software monitoring, written in Go but supports multiple languages using client libraries.
