# **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) - Comprehensive Guide**

## **1. Introduction to Load Balancers**
A **Load Balancer** acts as a **traffic manager** for web applications. It **evenly distributes** incoming web traffic across multiple servers (instances), ensuring that no single server gets overwhelmed. This improves **performance, reliability, and fault tolerance** while maintaining high availability.

### **Key Functions of a Load Balancer:**
- **Distributes traffic evenly** among multiple servers.
- **Sends traffic only to healthy instances** (performs health checks).
- **Ensures high availability** by rerouting traffic if a server fails.
