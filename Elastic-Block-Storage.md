# **Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Storage)**

## **1. Introduction to EBS**
- **EBS (Elastic Block Storage)** is a **block-level storage service** provided by AWS.
- It operates within a **SAN (Storage Area Network)**, meaning storage is **network-attached** rather than directly connected to the EC2 instance.
- EBS volumes can be **mounted** on EC2 instances and used as **persistent storage**.
